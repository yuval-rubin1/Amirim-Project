# Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an Amirim project exploring the oculomotor integrator of goldfish. This project is mainly based on 3 papers:

1. Functional dissection of circuitry in a neural integrator
   - Authors: Emre Aksay, Itsaso Olasagasti, Brett D Mensh, Robert Baker, Mark S Goldman, David W Tank
   - Published in Nature Neuroscience, 2007
   - [Link to paper](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2803116/)
2. Fixational drift is driven by diffusive dynamics in central neural circuitry
    - Authors: Nadav Ben-Shushan, Nimrod Shaham, Mati Joshua, Yoram Burak
    - Published in Nature Communications, 2022

3. Predicting modular functions and neural coding of behavior from a synaptic wiring diagram
    - Authors: Ashwin Vishwanathan, Alex Sood, Jingpeng Wu, Alexandro D. Ramirez, Runzhe Yang, Nico Kemnitz, Dodam Ih, Nicholas Turner, Kisuk Lee, Ignacio Tartavull, William M. Silversmith, Chris S. Jordan, Celia David, Doug Bland, Amy Sterling, H. Sebastian Seung, Mark S. Goldman, Emre R. F. Aksay & the Eyewirers

# 2007 Model
This directory contains the implementation of the the models offered by Goldman and NBS (Nadav Ben-Shushan) in the above papers. The code is based on the equations and parameters provided in the papers, as well as additional data files provided by NBS.

I encourage you to read the README.md file in the 2007_model directory for more details about the implementation and usage of the code.

# Connectome-based Model
